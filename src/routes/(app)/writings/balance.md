### But why does this matter..?

Well to be honest... it doesn't.

But it's still interesting to talk about!?

### Goals and expectations

Imagine that you're me. You want to find people to tutor, because uni is expensive and its nice to have some form of income. Great! Let's make a website describing yourself and try to get students that way. Additionally, as someone who likes to do 'fun' things like making a website, this also serves as a great learning opportunity!

And thus, two objectives come to mind.

- Make a website that effectively present myself in a way that lets potential students know what I think about learning in general, and how I may be a good tutor for them.
- Learn how to make a website and have fun as the same time!

### Problems...

These two objectives lead to further questions later down the line, such as: "How *should* I present myself on my website in order to come off as a good tutor?", "How do I have fun throughout the website-making process?", ~~"Why am I wasting so much time making a website when I can just sign up to [kis](https://kisacademics.com/)?"~~

Upon thinking it over, I think I've arrived at the core issue here.

### Professionalism and Personality

My parents told me that if I want to seem like a good tutor, I need to be very professional. I need to list my achievements, and write a brief and formal explanation as to why I believe I can be a good tutor. However, I believe this is directly in conflict with the second objective, i.e. to have fun! From my perspective, all of this could be done just by signing up to one of the many tutoring organisations in Australia, giving them a few details, and leting them do all the work for me. At that point, why spend all the effort making a website? Why take the time to learn entirely new framework and go through the struggles of web development if I'm not able to impart a piece of myself onto my work? 

In summary, being professional is boring. It doesn't stand out! And while I certainly do want to have students, I want the whole process to be enjoyable, and to be reflective of my own personality. 

Those that know me personally will attest that I'm not a professional person. I don't like to gel my hair, I don't care about the things I wear, etc. etc. And these qualities probably will persist in my tutoring work (maybe not to the extent where I'm showing up to lessons with a bedhead). But I don't believe that this should compromise the experience of making a website in a way that I have never done before. It shouldn't compromise my ability to have fun while doing it, and to be as authentic as possible.

### Compromise - dynamic equilibrium!! (chemistry reference)

Hope you were able to read through all that spiel above. Anyways, my solution to this was to achieve a compromise. A subtle balance between professional and personal. If you were to inspect this website closely, you may notice a gradual shift from the surface level being relatively professional, with small appearances of character, while the deeper level context being very informal and personal (like this writing right here). Is this a good thing? I guess so. On the one hand, it's rather foolish to think that most people would be bothered enough to get off the front page. So, having the front page being mostly professional is a good thing. On the other hand, I'm able to maintain my passion in making this website through being able to express myself in a more authentic manner, i.e. through these writings!

### Ok, bye

Thanks for sitting through all that. WACE exam review coming soonâ„¢.
