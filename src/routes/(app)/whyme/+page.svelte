<h2>1. I'm flexible</h2>
<p>I firmly believe that there isn't one definitive teaching method. Each and every stuent is different, and it takes a considerable amount of effort to find what works best. While I'll bring ideas and suggestions as to how we can run out lessons, ultimately I will leave it to you to decide. As the only person who truly know who you are, you are the best person to decide what style of teaching works for you.</p>
<h2>2. I want you to understand the content, and not just memorise</h2>
<p>I think that the key to success in one's high school studies is being able to understand the underlying concepts and ideas that underpin each question you may be present with. Many students fall into the trap of 'rote learning', and while this can take you reasonably far, it leaves you totally unprepared for novel and challenging 'discriminator' questions. Such questions necessitate a deeper and nuanced understanding of the topic at hand, which I aim to focus on in our lessons. While I will certainly make reference to and break down common exam questions, my hope is that I can help you master these questions so you can spend your time tackling more difficult and challenging questions.</p>
<h2>3. I value your time</h2>
<p>As someone with some experience with teaching high school concepts to others, I know for a fact that everyone learns in a unique way. I promise to be patient and receptive to any feedback you can give me, and I will make my best effort to work on it for next time, and to ensure the quality of my tutoring is only increasing. I will constantly be looking at whether the teaching I'm providing is beneficial to you, and ensure that your precious time is not wasted.</p>
