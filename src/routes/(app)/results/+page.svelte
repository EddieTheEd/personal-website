<p>Ultimately, I ended up with an ATAR of 99.95. However, I think this number can be a bit deceptive and fails to present the full picture. So to be transparent, I'll share with you my school and WACE results for all the subjects I took (except for Literature, because I did really badly ðŸ« )</p>

<p>I ended up with a TEA of 403.7. Not that great, and now you can see why!</p>
<p>While I may have done quite well in Specialist and Chinese (WACE-wise), Methods and Physics were quite a big let-down. When I get those exams back, I'll be sure to discuss where I went wrong here!</p>
<p>In terms of SCSA's awards, I was awarded the Subject Exhibition (highest mark in WACE) and Certificate of Excellence (top 0.5% WACE mark) in Mathematics Specialist. I also achieved the Certificate of Distinction (getting A's for year 11 and 12 in 5 subjects).</p>
