<p>I ended up with an ATAR of 99.95. See my WACE results below (excluding literature)!</p>

<p>While I may have done quite well in Specialist and Chinese (WACE-wise), Methods and Physics were quite a big let-down. When I get those exams back, I'll be sure to discuss where I went wrong here!</p>
<p>In terms of SCSA's awards, I was awarded the Subject Exhibition (highest mark in WACE) and Certificate of Excellence (top 0.5% WACE mark) in Mathematics Specialist. I also achieved the Certificate of Distinction (getting A's for year 11 and 12 in 5 subjects).</p>
