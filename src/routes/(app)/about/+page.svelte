<h3>Hi again!</h3>

<p>As I've said before, I graduated from Perth Modern School in 2024. In my final year, I studied Mathematics Methods and Specialist, Physics, Chinese Second Language and Literature. I accelerated Chemistry, and so I sat the 2023 WACE exam for Chemistry. Ultimately, I ended up with an ATAR of 99.95 and a Subject Exhibition in Mathematics Specialist.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to studying biomedicine in university, at any uni that wants to take me ;)</p>
<p>In my spare time, I like to play piano and make silly coding projects which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/EddieTheEd">Github</a>. I also like to play badminton with my friends, and I used to play chess for my school, representing Perth Modern School at interstate events. If you came up to me at school in year 12, you'd probably find me playing chess with Pranav on our favourite bench ‚ù§.</p>
