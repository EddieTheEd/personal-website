<p>I graduated from Perth Modern School in 2024. In my final year, I studied Mathematics Methods and Specialist, Physics, Chinese Second Language and Literature. I accelerated Chemistry, so I sat the 2023 WACE exam for Chemistry. Ultimately, I ended up with a <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/ZB07C/">99.95 ATAR</a> and a <a href="https://senior-secondary.scsa.wa.edu.au/certification/2024-exhibitions-and-awards-recipients-search-page#Edward%20Huynh:~:text=Subject%20Exhibition%3A%20Mathematics%20Specialist">Subject Exhibition in Mathematics Specialist</a>.</p>

<p>I have taken up the University of Melbourne's <a href="https://scholarships.unimelb.edu.au/awards/melbourne-chancellors-scholarship">Chancellor's Scholarship</a>, and will be following the guaranteed entry pathway for the University of Melbourne's <a href="https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/graduate/doctor-of-medicine/">Doctor of Medicine</a> course. I am currently working through completing a <a href="https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/undergraduate/bachelor-of-biomedicine/">Bachelor of Biomedicine</a>.</p>

<p>In 2023, I was awarded a Semester One Excellence Award in Chemistry. I also participated in the <a href="https://www.asi.edu.au/program/australian-science-olympiads/">Australian Chemistry Olympiad (AChO)</a> and was awarded a High Distinction.</p>
<p>At my graduation ceremony, I was awarded an Excellence Award in Mathematics Methods and the Award for Academic Excellence. In addition to this, I was also awarded the <a href="https://www.perthmodern.wa.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Year-12-Presentation-Ceremony-Prize-Winners-2024.pdf">Betty Sagar Sustainability Leadership Award</a>, and the Engineers Australia Certificate of Excellence for Science and Mathematics.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like to play piano and embark on coding projects which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/EddieTheEd">Github</a>. I also like to play badminton with my friends, and I used to represent Perth Modern School at interstate chess events.</p>
