<h3>Hi again!</h3>

<p>As I've said before, I graduated from Perth Modern School in 2024. In my final year, I studied Mathematics Methods and Specialist, Physics, Chinese Second Language and Literature. I accelerated Chemistry, and so I sat the 2023 WACE exam for Chemistry. Ultimately, I ended up with an ATAR of 99.95 and a Subject Exhibition in Mathematics Specialist.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to studying biomedicine in university, at any uni that wants to take me ;)</p>
<p>In my spare time, I like to play piano and make silly coding projects which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/EddieTheEd">Github</a>. I also like to play badminton with my friends.</p>
